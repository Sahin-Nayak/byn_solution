                    <span class="terms_span">Retention of Your Personal Data </span><br><br>
                    The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the
                    purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use Your Personal Data to the

                    agreements and policies. <br><br>
                    The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes. Usage Data is
                    generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to

                    offices and in any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located.
                    It means that this information may be transferred to — and maintained on —
                    computers located outside of Your state, province, country or other governmental
                    jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.
                    Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such information
                    represents Your agreement to that transfer. <br><br>
                    The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated
                    securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data 
                    will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in
                    place including the security of Your data and other personal information. <br><br>

                    <span class="terms_span">Delete Your Personal Data</span> <br><br>
                    You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that

                    Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within
                    the Service. <br><br>
                    You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your
                    Account, if you have one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to
                    manage Your personal information. You may also contact Us to request access to,
                    correct, or delete any personal information that You have provided to Us. <br><br>
                    Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a
                    legal obligation or lawful basis to do so. <br><br>

                    (e.g. a court or a government agency). <br><br>
                    <span class="terms_span">Other legal requirements</span><br>

                    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While
                    We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We
                    cannot guarantee its absolute security.
